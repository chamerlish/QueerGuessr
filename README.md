heelloooo, for the pride month i made this like *pride flag blind test* and stuff, since i made it in not even a week there are very few features rn, but do not worry people, i will finish it if i'm not lazy enough, rn thare a a ridicule ammount of flags included tbh as i intended the project to be more of a learning experience for discord.py than enything

## where from now?
as i said i do plan on work on it more, SPECIALLY IMPLEMENTING A WHOLE BUNCH OF MORE FLAGS, ofc since the project is literally just two files... merge requests is not our the window just saying...

tbh i don't see myself running this bot much tbh that's why i made it open source, so people can like run it locally with clones and stuff

*(ps: if i didn't add your flag yet just know that it is not not that i think your oriontation is ~invalid or unimportant~ in any shape of form, it's just a a timing issue, i'll try to add as much as possible in the future)*

*(ps: if i made any errors regarding any flag or oriontation description feel free to correct me, i am fr a newbie and just know i am not forcing my vision of things to anyone, these are just my basic understandings things that that **came out** during my "researchs")*

## features and commands:
firstly the command prefix is ":3", and currently there is just one command really and it's the ***play** command*, meaning to start playing you can just type: `:3 play` on any channel, just know that the games are not synced between one channel to another, meaning people playing on one channel do not have the same game as people on another

you can react with "🔁" on the bot's win message to get more infos on the oriontation and a basic documentation which is added manually for each identity, *(ps: i tried to use the urban dictionary api, and it worked, but let's just say urban dictionary is not the best place to get d̷e̷s̸c̷r̷i̷p̸t̷i̷o̴n̷s̷ ̷f̸͒ͅo̸̢̊r̸̜̓ ̴̲͐t̷̲̽h̸͉͝e̷̖̅s̸̹̔ḛ̶͋ ̵͈̈̃̃͗ͅs̸̔̾̕͜o̵͕̫͉̥͊̒̀̕r̶̠̎̂t̵̡̝̘̘͗̋͊ś̵̥̈̃͊ ̷͎̂o̶̟̿f̶̮̈́ ̶͎̯̈́̂͂̒ẗ̸͎̰̘̳̮̪̞́ḧ̶͓́̈́͆̐̓ĩ̴̮͊̐̿͒͑̄͘n̸̛̹̠̼͉̰̤̗͠g̷̨̪͎̜̦͒͋̈́͗̈́͘̕͠ś̶̡͉̗͈̮̱̣͈̓)*

## to conclude:
this is maybe the most fun project i did in a while as it happened in the best time to do so, this has tough me so much stuff about discord.py specially how `async tasks` works, **but most importanly:** spiritually and like about self identity without getting too personal ofc

### anyways have fun and be proud :3
